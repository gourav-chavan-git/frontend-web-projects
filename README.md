## Running Locally

Running the projects locally is a breeze. Just follow these simple steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory.
3. Launch the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

Since there are no bundlers used in this repository, all scripts have been directly injected into the HTML files. This allows for a straightforward setup and easy execution of the projects.
